# OPSO-m Algorithm Overview
The Orthogonal Particle Swarm Optimization with Mutation (OPSO-m) is a novel algorithm that enhances the standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) by integrating orthogonal
array-based initialization and advanced mutation strategies. This hybrid approach aims to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the swarm, leading to more
efficient optimization performance, particularly in complex search spaces.
